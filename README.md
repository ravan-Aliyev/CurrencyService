# Currency Service API

A robust, scalable, and maintainable currency conversion API built with C# and ASP.NET Core 8.0, providing high performance, security, and resilience. The service integrates with the Frankfurter API to deliver real-time and historical exchange rates with comprehensive error handling and monitoring.

## Features

- **Latest Exchange Rates**: Fetch the latest exchange rates for a specific base currency
- **Currency Conversion**: Convert amounts between different currencies with real-time rates
- **Historical Exchange Rates**: Retrieve historical exchange rates for a given period (Admin role required)
- **Resilience & Performance**:
  - Caching to minimize direct calls to the Frankfurter API
  - Retry policies with exponential backoff
  - Circuit breaker pattern for graceful handling of API outages
- **Security & Access Control**:
  - JWT authentication with role-based access control (RBAC)
  - API throttling to prevent abuse
  - Restricted currency handling (TRY, PLN, THB, MXN are blocked)
- **Logging & Monitoring**:
  - Structured logging with Serilog
  - Seq integration for centralized log management
  - Request/response correlation
  - Detailed request logging (client IP, client ID, method, endpoint, response code, response time)
- **API Versioning**: Full support for API versioning with backward compatibility

## Architecture

The project follows Clean Architecture principles with the following layers:

- **API Layer** (`CurrencyService.Api`): Controllers, middleware, and API models
- **Application Layer** (`CurrencyService.Application`): Business logic, CQRS with MediatR, and application services
- **Domain Layer** (`CurrencyService.Domain`): Domain models, interfaces, and business rules
- **Infrastructure Layer** (`CurrencyService.Infrasturucture`): External service integrations, caching, security, and data access

### Why This Architecture for a Currency Service API?

This architecture was specifically chosen for a currency service API for several key benefits:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each layer has a distinct responsibility, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to understand. For a currency service that needs to handle various exchange rate providers, conversion logic, and API endpoints, this clear separation helps manage complexity.

2. **Dependency Rule**: Dependencies flow inward, with the Domain layer having no dependencies on outer layers. This ensures that business logic remains independent of implementation details. This is particularly valuable for a currency service that might need to switch between different exchange rate providers without affecting core conversion logic.

3. **Testability**: The use of interfaces and dependency injection makes the code highly testable, allowing for effective unit testing without external dependencies. For financial applications like currency services, high test coverage is critical to ensure accurate calculations and reliable service.

4. **Flexibility**: The architecture allows for easy replacement of external components (like the currency provider) without affecting the core business logic. This is essential for a currency service that needs to maintain service continuity even if an external provider becomes unavailable.

5. **Scalability**: As the application grows, new features can be added without significant refactoring of existing code. The currency service might need to add features like historical rate analysis, currency alerts, or support for cryptocurrencies in the future.

6. **Resilience**: By isolating external dependencies in the Infrastructure layer, the application can implement resilience patterns (retry, circuit breaker, fallback) to handle external service failures gracefully. This is crucial for a currency service that depends on third-party APIs for rate data.

7. **Security**: The layered approach allows for implementing security concerns at appropriate levels - authentication and authorization at the API layer, while keeping business rules protected in the Domain layer. For financial data, this separation helps maintain proper security boundaries.

### Key Design Patterns

- **CQRS Pattern**: Command Query Responsibility Segregation using MediatR
- **Factory Pattern**: Used for creating appropriate currency providers
- **Dependency Injection**: Used throughout the application for loose coupling
- **Options Pattern**: Used for configuration management (e.g., restricted currencies, JWT settings)
- **Pipeline Behavior**: Cross-cutting concerns like validation using MediatR pipeline behaviors

## Technology Stack

- **.NET 8.0**: Latest LTS version with performance improvements
- **ASP.NET Core**: Modern web framework with built-in dependency injection
- **MediatR**: Implementation of CQRS pattern and mediator pattern
- **Mapster**: High-performance object mapping library
- **Polly**: Resilience and transient-fault-handling capabilities
- **Serilog**: Structured logging with multiple sinks
- **Seq**: Centralized log management and analysis
- **JWT Bearer**: Secure authentication mechanism
- **Swagger/OpenAPI**: API documentation and testing interface
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment

## Configuration

### Appsettings Configuration

The application uses configuration files for various settings:

**Development Configuration (`appsettings.Development.json`):**

```json
{
  "FrankfurtApi": {
    "BaseUrl": "https://api.frankfurter.app"
  },
  "UsersData": {
    "Users": [
      {
        "UserName": "user1",
        "Password": "password123",
        "Roles": ["User"]
      },
      {
        "UserName": "admin",
        "Password": "admin123",
        "Roles": ["Admin"]
      }
    ]
  },
  "Jwt": {
    "Key": "supersecretkey1234567890supersecretkey12345678901234567890",
    "Issuer": "MyApi",
    "Audience": "MyApiUsers"
  }
}
```

### Restricted Currencies

The following currencies are restricted and cannot be used:

- TRY (Turkish Lira)
- PLN (Polish ZÅ‚oty)
- THB (Thai Baht)
- MXN (Mexican Peso)

## Testing

The project includes a comprehensive testing strategy with multiple test types:

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation, using mocks for dependencies. The project includes:

- **Service Tests**: Verify the business logic in the Application layer
- **Provider Tests**: Ensure correct interaction with external APIs
- **Error Handling Tests**: Validate proper exception handling
- **Edge Case Tests**: Test boundary conditions and input validation

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different components work correctly together:

- **API Provider Tests**: Test the actual integration with the Frankfurter API
- **End-to-End Flows**: Verify complete business processes from request to response

![Test Coverage](coverage.png)

## Error Handling

The API uses a global exception handling middleware that returns consistent error responses:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": "Error message describing the issue",
  "errors": null
}
```

Multiple validation errors

```json
{
  "message": "Multiple errors occurred.",
  "statusCode": 400,
  "errors": [
    "Base currency must be exactly 3 characters long.",
    "From currency must consist of 3 uppercase letters.",
    "Base currency must be exactly 3 characters long.",
    "To currency must consist of 3 uppercase letters.",
    "Amount must be greater than zero."
  ]
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:

- `200 OK`: Request succeeded
- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid input or validation error
- `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid authentication
- `403 Forbidden`: Authenticated but not authorized for the resource
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Unexpected server error
